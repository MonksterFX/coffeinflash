## proposal for this project

- Starting a chat by a **shareable url**. I really appreciate it the way [**jitsi**](https://meet.jit.si/) does it.
- Having **Nicknames**
- Meeting **random people** connect to random available people
- **Destroying** each chat after you leave the page/close the session (also means storing nothing in the backend)
- No user accounts what so ever...
